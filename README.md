Todo is CLI app written in Rust!
Users can add and remove tasks to a list which saves between sessions.
When a task is complete, they can mark tasks as 'done', then delete the task from their list if they want.
To try it yourself, pull the repo and add the target/release/todo file to their /usr/bin directory (on Linux).

Enjoy!
